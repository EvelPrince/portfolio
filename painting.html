        <p>This was my first serious painting I did on canvas. I call it "Mixed Signals". It is done in acrylic on 12" by 14" canvas. I made it over summer when I was struggling with my sense of purpose and was feeling frustrated.</p>
        <img src="images/stillife.jpg" alt="still life" id="img8">
        <p>This was my first oil painting done in my painting 1 class this fall semester. It is a still life using things I have around my house. The color palette is the main draw of this piece.</p>
        <img src="images/collage.jpg" alt="collage painting" id="img8">
        <p>My second painting in painting class. We made a small 4"x4" collage and then scaled it up into an oil painting on a 26"x26" painting. I really love this painting! One of my favorite creations. It is heavily inspired by 80's sci-fi horror with its color palette.</p>
