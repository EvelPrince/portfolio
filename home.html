        <h2>About My Art</h2>
        <p><img src="images/22me.jpg" alt="selfie of Evel" id="img1">My art is greatly inspired by the media I have consumed growing up. <br>I have always loved film, especially content from the 80's era.<br> I am also greatly attracted to jewel tones and strong contrasting color palettes.<br> Music plays a big theme in the emotions behind the pieces I create as well; <br>certain soundtracks help create the tone of different pieces.<br> I'm sure as I continue to learn and grow, my tastes and influences will change as well.</p>
