        <img src="images/albumcover.jpg" alt="album cover" id="img9">
        <p>Album cover redesign done for my color theory class. We took a band/artist and made them into a new genre. I chose Thundercat, a funk artist, and made him into a metal artist. This was a really fun assignment I just finished!</p><br>
        <img src="images/bookcover.jpg" alt="book cover" id="img9">
        <p>This was a similar project done in my graphic design 2 class where we redesigned book covers. I made Edgar Allen Poe's "Masque of the Red Death" into a sci-fi horror. Another project I loved and I won third placed in the art show for!</p><br>
        <img src="images/compostposter.jpg" alt="green poster" id="img9">
        <p>A quick graphic design 2 exercise to practice poster design in-between projects. I made this a sort of comical poster about becoming compost when you die instead of simple cremation as an eco-friendly option. I love the complementary colors in this. I repurposed a photography project for it.</p><br>
        <img src="images/deathposter.jpg" alt="death poster" id="img9">
        <p>This was my first serious project in graphic design 1. It is a current events poster for climate change. This got into the Skyway art competition.</p>
