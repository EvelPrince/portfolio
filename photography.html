        <p>These are just a few of my photos I have taken this year. The first photo of is of my grandmothers sewing machine silhoutted by the rainy evening behind it. The second photo is of a gas station at night in the rain. It feels very nostalgic to me, something about the midwest in the fall reminds me of going to the gas station. The third is a reflection os my brothers when we went to Chicago on the train. The fourth photo is of a bison at a state park near Starved Rock. The Fifth photo was a part of my photography 2 final and part of my video project. I really like the colors in that photo in particular. And finally is a picture of the fully moon, completely obscured by my tremor. I want to try being more experimental in my photography in the coming year. </p>
